# dot-nvim

This is my Neovim configuration, with a `packer` installer to bootstrap installation automatically on fresh cloning.

1. Export `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` shell environment variable so `nvim` knows where to
   find all it's configuration files, which are separated according to function.

2. Launch `nvim`

3. Inside Neovim run `:PackerInstall`
