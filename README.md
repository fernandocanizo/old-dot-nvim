# dot-nvim

This is my Neovim configuration, with an installer to have new machines editor
running as I'm used to in not time.

1. Execute `install` script to get [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/)

2. Export `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` shell environment variable so `nvim` knows where to
   find all it's configuration files, which are separated according to function.

3. Inside neovim run `:PlugInstall`
