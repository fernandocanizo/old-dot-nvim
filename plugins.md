- https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot

- https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag

- https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
  I have already tried this one, now, as I'm writing this, I'm about to try
  coq.nvim, which looks better on the docs at least. So maybe I'll move this one
  to the history section.

- https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
- https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
  (needs both to make it work, plus `fzf` installed on system)
  Not sure: looks pretty cool, fast and useful, but I'm not sure if I'll use it
  so much that it will worth the time investing in configuring it, since it
  looks it needs an specific configuration for each thing where you wanna apply
  `fzf`. Besides it requires `fzf` to be installed on the system, so that
  breaks a little bit the concept of this repo, which is to have a drop-in
  configuration that can get you up and running quickly on new machines.

- https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine
  I have a configuration problem with another plugin which provides same
  thing as this one (https://github.com/thaerkh/vim-indentguides), so maybe try
  it later, and see if I can avoid those problems

- https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat
  To repeat with dot command (.) complex things that come from a plugin

- https://github.com/tpope/vim-speeddating
  Understand dates and can use nvim increment command to changes dates in a
  consistent way.

- https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter
  Not sure about this, but if it allows me to comment blocks of code easily,
  then use it.

- https://github.com/ms-jpq/sad
  It looks like an alternative to `sed`, which would be pretty cool since I have
  a poor knowledge of `sed`.

- https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree
  "File Manager for Neovim, Better than NERDTree"
  With that claim in the README I have to try it. Also comes from the author of
  `coq.nvim` which will be my next completion plugin.
