# Neovim links

Things taken from IRC chat history, some I don't know what they are, so
investigate! :)

- https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/
  Make internal nvim browser work like nerdtree, so no nerdtree needed. I don't
  know if this will be relevant after I try chadTree

- https://yadm.io to manage dotfiles

- Searching for "ultimate vimrc" shows a bunch of repos that kinda do the same
  as my dot-nvim repo, it can be a cool way to hunt for new stuff when I'm
  bored.
