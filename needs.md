# Needs

I currently have my nvim configuration in a state of mayhem, with lots of stuff
brought from previous vim configuration, stuff that probably doesn't work
anymore, and stuff I don't really use or seldom use.

So I'm gonna try to bring order and start with the most needed stuff, which is:

- A good completion system

- A good plugin that reads configured linter on repo and uses it

- A good syntax highlighter

- A nice colorscheme. I have tons of themes and I don't really know which one
  I'm using.

Also I'll start documenting each plugin tried and the reasons why I dropped
them.

Also I'll start a list of pluginsto try. Sometimes I see something cool,
install it, but then forget about it and I never really try it properly. So it's
preferably to not clog my conf with shit I don't use but list them on a text
file, so I don't have to hunt for them later.
